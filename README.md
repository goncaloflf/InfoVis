# League Of Legends' Champions - Season 7

This visualization was created from scratch for the [Information Visualization](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/disciplinas/VI25/2016-2017/1-semestre) course, which is part of the MSc in Interaction and Visualiation from [Instituto Superior Técnico](http://tecnico.ulisboa.pt). 

This visualization was created with love by:
  - [Gonçalo Ferreira](https://github.com/goncaloflf)
  - [Nuno Faria](https://github.com/FatherNuno)
  - [Miguel Ribeiro](https://github.com/ribeiralves)

This vis' is divided in two main areas: the red area (in the top) and the blue area (in the bottom). On the red area you can see the overall statistics from a particular champion, and compare it to other champions in the game (as well the same champion, but in different lanes). On the blue area you'll see the stats for the generality of the game. Fell free to click on the little sliders on the center and see everything changing!

To create this project, we downloaded data from 90000 games on 3 different servers (EUW, NA, KR).
